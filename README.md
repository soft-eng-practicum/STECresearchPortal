STEC Research Portal

> Design a replacement web interface for our STEC project listings

> Note that this platform may be going away sometime down the road, so

> Our goal is to develop a web based program that will make it much

> Since eventual platform is still up in the air, students should

> In addition, the design should take into account that it should be

Meet the Team ðŸ“¦
---------------

We are the **Cardboard Consultancy**, a group of individually talented
students banded together (whether by will or force is a different
story) to provide our college with a new portal for STEC research
opportunities.  In other words, we're working on a project for our
Software Development II course (ITEC 3870).
